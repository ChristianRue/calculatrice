# Calculatrice

A mini console-based computer algebra system in Matlab style syntax. Input is processed line-wise. Type in a valid expression followed by the return key. In what follows we will describe in more detail, what a valid expression is. 

- Spaces are stripped from the input and therefore have no further effect.

- "#" is a valid expression terminating the program.

- Real numbers in usual floating point syntax.

- Mathematical expressions using the operations "+", "-", "*", "/", "%" (modulo), "^" (power), "!" (factorial) and brackets. Mathematical expressions are evaluated in the proper way respecting the common rules. Moreover "/" can be used as a unary operator for multiplicative inversion just in the same way as "-" is a unary operator for additive inversion, e.g. the expression "/2" is a valid expression for the term "0.5". Infact virtually both "-" and "/" are treated only as unary operators and expressions like 2-1 are translated to 2 + -1 before evaluation. The unary operator "!" only accepts positive integers.

- Imaginary numbers can be used via the unary operator "i", e.g. "1+2i" is a valid expression for the corresponding complex number.

- Matrices in Matlab style syntax, i.e. a matrix is determined by rows separated via ";" and framed by rectengular bracket, where each of the rows is a finite sequence of numbers separated by ",", e.g. "[1,2,3;4,5,6]" determines a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns, the numbers 1,2,3 lying on the first and the numbers 4,5,6 lying on the second row. Numbers can be complex and even matrices itself, as long as these can be merged in a proper way to a bigger matrix. So the upper matrix can also be described by "[[1;4],[2,3;5,6]]", whereas "[1,2;3]" is not a valid expression. 1xn matrices are treated as row vectors, nx1 matrices as columns vectors and 1x1 matrices as complex numbers.

- Shorter expressions for range row vectors in Matlab style syntax, i.e. "[a : b]" determines the row vector with entries a, a+1, a+2, ... up to the tallest number a+n < b with natural n. More generally "[a : b : c]" determines the row vector a, a+b, a+2b, ... up to the tallest number a+bn < c.

- Mathematical expressions can also be formed with matrices instead of complex numbers, as long as they make sense mathematically. E.g. "/M" computes the inverse of a matrix M, if it is defined. The operators "%" and "!" are only defined for numbers, the power operator "^" accepts only integer values as a second argument, if the first one is a matrix. The operator "'" forms the transpose of a matrix.

- Variables can be defined via "<name> = <expression>". Valid names for variables are strings consisting of small and capital letters, numbers and underscores. The first character must be a letter. Variables can store matrix values and can be used as these in expressions. Assigned variables are stored in the file "vmem.mem", so variables are kept after a restart of the program unless you do not delete the file "vmem.mem". The variable "pi" is pre-defined, but can temporarily be overwritten until the next restart of the program. So the variable "pi" is the only one that will not be stored, but reset after restart. 

- Functions can be defined via "<function> = <expression>". Here <function> is a valid name (see previous section about variables) followed by a list of names for arguments separated by "," and bracketed by round brackets, e.g. "f(x,y)". Of course the expression on the right depends on the arguments on the left, e.g. "f(x,y) = x+y" defines a function called "f" computing the sum of the two arguments x and y. Functions can be evaluated in the usual mathematical way and can be built into mathematical expressions. Like variables also the user-defined functions are stored in a memory file "fmem.mem". The definition of a function can be recalled by using the expression "<function_name>?". Like for the variable "pi" there are also built-in functions, that can be overwritten but will be reset after restart. We will only list their names, because a detailed description of their definition can be obtained in the same way as for the user-defined functions:
